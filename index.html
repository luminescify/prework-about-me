      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name's Leah and I'm a Graphic Designer that enjoys all things geeky. I'm originally from Florida but moved to Chicago to attend DePaul University and graduated in 2019. When Covid hit, I moved back home and have since been enjoying indulging in my hobbies, spending time with my family, and improving my creative skills.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Orlando, FL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>If I'm not designing, you'll likely find me with my nose buried in a book, burning my eyes out in front of a screen playing video games, or snuggling my dogs (and kitty Milo).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm still figuring this out, but at the moment I would love to try out being a UX/UI designer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Orlando, FL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think coding is fascinating and I enjoy creative problem solving. Web development allows me to take my love of design and mix it with my interest in coding. It's something I got to learn a little of in college, but not nearly enough, so I'm deciding to pursue it further.</p>
